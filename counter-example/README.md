# React/Redux ChatGPT Counter Demo

*See the [blog post](https://spindas.dreamwidth.org/4207.html) for more information!*

This is a super basic [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) counter app, but without any explicitly-implemented reducers. Instead, the initial state and actions are fed through [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), which predicts new states automatically! This is implemented via the [`react-redux-chatgpt`](https://github.com/spinda/react-redux-chatgpt/tree/main/react-redux-chatgpt) plugin.
