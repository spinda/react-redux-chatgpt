# React/Redux ChatGPT TodoMVC Demo

*See the [blog post](https://spindas.dreamwidth.org/4207.html) for more information!*

This is the [React/Redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc) implementing a todo list app, but with the reducers deleted (i.e., no business logic). Instead, the app's initial state and actions are fed through [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), which predicts new states automatically! This is implemented via the [`react-redux-chatgpt`](https://github.com/spinda/react-redux-chatgpt/tree/main/react-redux-chatgpt) plugin.
